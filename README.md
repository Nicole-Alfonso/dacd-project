## Project Objective

**Project Objectives:**

The main objective of this project is to integrate and process real-time and delayed data from 
the **Xotelo** and **Ticketmaster** APIs to offer users personalized accommodation recommendations based on their event interests. By analyzing the events selected on Ticketmaster, the system will identify key locations and dates and cross-reference this information with Xotelo to suggest accommodation options tailored to different price ranges. This seeks to optimize the user experience, facilitating travel and stay planning, while adding value by combining two data sources into a single, functional product.
